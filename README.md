# things3

A command-line interface for [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) that communicates
directly with the Things Cloud API — keeping all your tasks in sync across your Apple devices.

## Quick Start

Authenticate with your Things Cloud credentials:

```
$ things3 set-auth
Things Cloud email: you@example.com
Things Cloud password: ••••••••••••
```

Then run commands:

```
$ things3 today
⭑ Today  (5 tasks)

  ○ Morning routine
  ○ Complete taxes  ⚑ due by 2026-04-10
  ○ Update software packages

  ☽ This Evening
  ○ Write down favorite thing about today
```
